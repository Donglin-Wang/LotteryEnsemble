# LotteryEnsemble: LotteryFL re-implementation and experiments

This repo is used for experimenting with the LotteryFL model. The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03371). As of right now, we are trying to combine the functionalities of these three reports:
1. https://github.com/AshwinRJ/Federated-Learning-PyTorch Implementation of the FedAvg algorithm. The original paper for FedAvg can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)
2. https://github.com/jeremy313/non-iid-dataset-for-personalized-federated-learning Offical repo for LotteryFL. As of 2020/10/14, this repo only contains the code for generating their dataset.
3. https://github.com/rahulvigneswaran/Lottery-Ticket-Hypothesis-in-Pytorch Re-implementation of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). The original paper for LTH can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)

## Preliminary Plan:
- **2020/10/14:** Create repo, decide on a bare-bone project structure
